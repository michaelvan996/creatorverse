## Notes
- Initially the documentation was easy to follow. However, the databse need to have unique value for some CRUD functionalities to work
- There are complexities and need more attentions on passing in props and manage state
- My initial experience with routing and implementing redirects was a bit challenging. However, it was well worth it after realize how intuitive it is
